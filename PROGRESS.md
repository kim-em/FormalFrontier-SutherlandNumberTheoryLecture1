All Phase 1 stages completed on 2026-03-16.

### Stage 1.1: Page Extraction
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16

### Stage 1.2: Start Lean Build
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** Lean project initialized as `SutherlandNumberTheoryLecture1` with Mathlib dependency. `lake build` passes.

### Stage 1.3: Frontmatter Detection

**Notes:** 8 content pages mapped as `pdf/pages/1.pdf`–`8.pdf`. 1 backmatter page (`pdf/pages/backmatter-1.pdf`). Mapping recorded in `pdf/pages/mapping.json`.

### Stage 1.4: Page Transcription
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** All 9 pages transcribed to markdown with LaTeX math. Conventions documented in `pages/CONVENTIONS.md`. Transcription quality reviewed for all 9 pages (pages 2–7 in PR #35; pages 1, 8, backmatter-1 in PR #47). No errors found.

### Stage 1.5: Structure Analysis
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** `items.json` created with 38 content blobs covering every line of every page. Contiguity verified by `scripts/check_contiguity.py` — no gaps or overlaps.

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Introduction | 1 |
| Definitions | 11 |
| Theorems | 4 |
| Propositions | 5 |
| Corollaries | 3 |
| Lemmas | 1 |
| Examples | 6 |
| Remarks | 2 |
| Discussion | 6 |
| Bibliography | 1 |
| Backmatter | 1 |
| **Total** | **38** |

### Stage 1.6: Blob Extraction
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** 38 blob files extracted to `blobs/Lecture1/` using `scripts/extract_blobs.py`. Round-trip verified: concatenation reproduces original page content exactly.

### Stage 1.7: Indexing
**Status:** Skipped (optional)

## Phase 2: Dependency Mapping — Complete

All Phase 2 stages completed on 2026-03-16. This phase produced the dependency graph, Mathlib coverage research, readiness report, and per-item reference files.

### Stage 2.1: Internal Dependency Analysis
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** `dependencies/internal.json` created with 38 entries in a conservative linear chain. Each item depends only on its immediate predecessor. Will be refined to actual dependencies in Stage 3.3 after formalization.

### Stage 2.2: External Dependency Analysis
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** `dependencies/external.json` identifies 35 external dependencies. Categories: 26 undergraduate prerequisites, 3 external results, 5 folklore facts. All formalizable items have at least one external dependency listed.

### Stage 2.3: Blueprint Assembly
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** leanblueprint scaffolding in `blueprint/` with LaTeX source. 73 nodes in the dependency graph (38 items + 35 external deps). HTML dependency graph buildable via `plastex`. Scripts: `scripts/generate_blueprint.py`.

### Stage 2.4: Research — Mathlib Coverage
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** `research/mathlib-coverage.json` covers all 29 items; `research/external-coverage.json` covers all 35 external dependencies.

**Formalizable items (27 total, excluding 2 remarks tracked in coverage but not formalizable):**
- Fully covered by Mathlib: 20 (74%) — primarily wrappers around existing API
- Partially covered: 4 (15%) — core concepts exist, assembly or gap-filling needed
- Not covered: 3 (11%) — require original work

**Not-covered items (hardest):**
- Theorem 1.9: Product formula for absolute values on Q
- Example 1.24: Z[sqrt(5)] is not integrally closed
- Example 1.29: (1+sqrt(7))/2 is integral over Z

**External dependencies (35 total):**
- Fully covered: 30 (86%)
- Partially covered: 4 (11%)
- Not covered: 1 (3%) — discrete subgroups of R isomorphic to Z

### Stage 2.5: Research — External Sources
**Status:** Complete (partial)
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** Issue #49 closed. `research/external-sources.json` was not delivered; however, `mathlib-coverage.json` and `external-coverage.json` provide the needed data for formalization. Low impact gap.

### Stage 2.6: Readiness Report
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** `READINESS.md` written. Categorizes 27 formalizable items by effort: 14 easy (Mathlib wrappers), 10 medium (assembly needed), 3 hard (from scratch). Identifies 5 parallel formalization batches and critical paths.

### Stage 2.7: Reference Attachment
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Notes:** 27 `.refs.md` files created under `blobs/Lecture1/`, one per formalizable item. Each contains relevant Mathlib declaration names, match types, and external dependency references. Manifest in `research/refs-manifest.json`. Script: `scripts/generate_refs.py`.

## Phase 3: Formalization — Complete

All Phase 3 stages completed on 2026-03-17. All 27 formalizable items are proof-polished (sorry-free, lint-clean, Mathlib-quality). Dependencies trimmed to actual Lean imports. Upstreaming analysis completed with 5 candidates identified.

### Stage 3.1: Lean Scaffolding

| #69 | Batch 3 | Thm 1.8; Defs 1.10, 1.11; Prop 1.20; Cor 1.21 |
| #73 | Batch 4 | Defs 1.12, 1.13; Exs 1.14, 1.15; Thm 1.16; Props 1.22, 1.25; Cor 1.23 |
| #93 | Batch 5 | Def 1.26; Thm 1.9; Ex 1.24; Ex 1.29 |

### Stage 3.2: Proof Filling
**Status:** Complete — 27/27 sorry-free (100%)
**Date:** 2026-03-16 to 2026-03-17

**Proof filling PRs:**

| PR | Items | Strategy |
|----|-------|----------|
| #72 | Prop 1.18, Def 1.7, Ex 1.3 | Mathlib API wrappers |
| #76 | Prop 1.20, Cor 1.21 | DVR properties via Mathlib |
| #78 | Lemma 1.4, Cor 1.5 | Nonarchimedean tactic proofs |
| #79 | Prop 1.22, Cor 1.23, Prop 1.25 | Integral closure via Mathlib |
| #84 | Ex 1.14, Ex 1.15 | DVR examples — instance + computation |
| #87 | Thm 1.8, Thm 1.16, Prop 1.28 | Theorem wrappers around Mathlib |
| #95 | Def 1.26 | Number fields definition |
| #96 | Ex 1.29 | Non-integral element — nlinarith + algebraic |
| #100 | Ex 1.24 | Z[√5] not integrally closed — contradiction |
| #102 | Thm 1.9 | Product formula — the hardest item |

### Item Progress Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| `proof_polished` | 27 |
| `not_applicable` | 11 |
| **Total** | **38** |

All 27 formalizable items are proof-polished (sorry-free, lint-clean, Mathlib-quality).

### Stage 3.3: Dependency Trimming
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Notes:** Conservative linear chain in `dependencies/internal.json` replaced with actual Lean import-derived dependencies (PR #107). Result: most Lean files are standalone (no internal imports from other formalized items). Only Corollary 1.5 depends on Lemma 1.4. Discussion items retain dependencies on the formal items they discuss.

### Stage 3.4: Proof Polishing
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Notes:** All 27 formalizable items polished to Mathlib quality. Proofs simplified, redundant steps removed, linting issues fixed. Theorem 1.16 rewritten to match PDF's 7-item DVR characterization. Mathlib delegation refactors applied to Example 1.3, Example 1.14, and Proposition 1.28. Full project lint audit passed with zero warnings.

- `generate_refs.py` — generates .refs.md reference files from coverage data
- `init_items_progress.py` — initializes progress/items.json from items.json

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/`):

- `second-opinion` — get a second opinion from OpenAI Codex
- `acquiring-skills` — create or update Claude Code skills
- `ci-troubleshooting` — diagnostic steps for CI failures
- `parallel-agent-coordination` — best practices for avoiding merge conflicts
- `lean-proof-strategies` — strategies for filling sorry placeholders
- `mathlib-api-lookup` — searching for Mathlib declarations
- `aristotle-escalation` — automated theorem prover escalation
- `project-retrospective` — transferable lessons from this formalization

## Known Limitations

- **Blueprint HTML not in CI:** The leanblueprint HTML graph can be built locally but is not part of CI.
